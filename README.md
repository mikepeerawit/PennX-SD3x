This repository is for the assigments I did on Algorithm Design and Analysis course on edX by University of Pennsylvania.

Course Description:

This course, part of the CS Essentials for Software Development Professional Certificate program, takes an abstract, conceptual approach to the task of writing sophisticated, but efficient programs for complex computational tasks. When confronted with a computational problem, you will learn to model it abstractly and then design and analyze an algorithm to solve it. Critically, the course will focus on the correctness and efficiency of software by examining the mathematical underpinnings of the design and analysis of algorithms.
